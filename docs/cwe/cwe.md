# Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

!!! abstract "Overview"

    The [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org) is a community-driven catalog of software and hardware weaknesses, maintained by MITRE. It serves as a standardized language and baseline for identifying, describing, and understanding common security flaws in software and hardware architecture, design, code, and implementation. 
    
    By providing a common taxonomy, CWE facilitates consistent security vulnerability reporting, enables better tool integration, and supports data-driven analysis of security trends. 
    
    Leveraging CWE is fundamental to shifting security left, allowing organizations to proactively address the root causes of vulnerabilities and build more secure systems.

## What is a Weakness?

A weakness, in the context of CWE, is a a state or condition in software or hardware that *could* lead to a security vulnerability. Unlike a vulnerability (like a CVE), which is a specific instance of a flaw in a particular product or system, a weakness is a more general description of a type of programming error, design flaw, or architectural issue.

## Why CWE Matters

!!! tip

     CWEs apply to all vulnerabilities: 
     
     - CVEs, and vulnerabilities that don't have CVEs, including those that are internal to an organization.

     CWEs allow the identification of vulnerabilities, and eradication of classes of vulnerabilities by weakness.

* **Unified Language:** Provides a standard, unambiguous way for developers, security analysts, and tools to discuss and categorize security issues.
* **Improved Tooling:** Security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA) often map their findings to CWE IDs, enabling better integration and correlation of results.
* **Proactive Security:** Focuses on the underlying causes of vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to implement preventive measures in the development lifecycle.
* **Enhanced Analysis:** Enables tracking and analysis of prevalent weaknesses (like the CWE Top 25), helping organizations prioritize remediation efforts and identify areas for developer training.
* **Compliance and Benchmarking:** Increasingly referenced by security standards and regulations, facilitating compliance and allowing organizations to benchmark their security posture.




## Root Cause Mapping Value

!!! quote

     Root cause mapping is the identification of the underlying cause(s) of a vulnerability. This is best done by correlating CVE Records and/or bug or vulnerability tickets with CWE entries. https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/cwe_usage/guidance.html

Mapping vulnerabilities (CVEs) back to their underlying CWE weaknesses offers significant value:

* **Trend Analysis:** Enables visibility into patterns of weaknesses over time, highlighting recurring issues.
* **Targeted Investment:** Identifies the root causes that contribute most to vulnerabilities, guiding where to invest resources in training, process improvement, and tools.
* **Insight into Exploitability:** Understanding the weakness type can provide clues about the potential exploitability of a vulnerability.
* **Feedback Loop:** Provides critical feedback to development teams and architects on common errors to avoid in future development.

## CWE in the SDLC

Integrating CWE throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is key to building secure software:

* **Requirements & Design:** Use CWE to inform threat modeling and define security requirements based on common weakness types.
* **Implementation:** Educate developers on CWEs relevant to their technology stack to prevent introducing weaknesses. Use static analysis tools that identify CWEs.
* **Testing:** Design security tests and vulnerability scans that specifically look for common CWEs.
* **Deployment & Operations:** Use CWE to understand the root cause of vulnerabilities found in production and inform patching and remediation strategies.

!!! tip "Actionable Insight"
    Shift left by incorporating CWE awareness and testing early in your development pipeline. This is far more cost-effective than fixing vulnerabilities later.

## Challenges in Using CWE

While invaluable, using CWE effectively can present challenges:

* **Mapping Complexity:** Accurately mapping specific vulnerabilities to the correct CWE can sometimes be challenging due to the nuanced nature of weaknesses and the structure of the CWE hierarchy.
* **Abstraction Levels:** Choosing the appropriate CWE abstraction level (Base, Class, Variant) for reporting and analysis requires understanding the purpose (e.g., remediation vs. high-level trends). (See the [CWE Abstraction](./cwe_abstraction.md) page for more details).

!!! caution "Avoid Common Pitfalls"
    Resist the urge to map vulnerabilities to overly general CWEs (like those at the Class or Pillar level) when a more specific Base or Variant CWE is available. Precision is key for effective remediation and analysis.

!!! success "Takeaways"

    * Embrace CWE as the foundational language for understanding and discussing software and hardware security weaknesses.
    * Integrate CWE into your SDLC to enable proactive security and root cause analysis.
    * Leverage CWE for better vulnerability management, targeted remediation, and improved security posture benchmarking.
    * Focus on mapping to specific CWEs (Base or Variant) whenever possible for actionable insights.
