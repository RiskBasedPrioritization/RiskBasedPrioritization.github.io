!!! tip "Start by picking an EPSS Threshold around 10%"
    Start by picking an EPSS Threshold around 10%, and adjust based on your CVE data and your capacity to remediate the CVEs above that Threshold (in conjunction with CVSS Severity or other Risk factors).

    Plotting the data for your organization can help refine this EPSS Threshold value.
    
    You can further adjust this EPSS Threshold as CVEs are remediated, and as you gain more experience with EPSS.
