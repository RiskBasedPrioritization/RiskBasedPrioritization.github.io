    1. The dot colors indicate what population the CVE is associated with e.g. if the CVE is red, then it's in CISA KEV:
          1. red: CISA KEV
          2. purple: both metasploit and nuclei
          3. orange: metasploit only
          4. yellow: nuclei only
          5. green: exploitdb only, and not in metasploit or nucle
    2. The histogram on top represents the counts of CVEs (in bins) at that CVSS BaseScore.
    3. The histogram on the right represents the counts of CVEs (in bins) at that EPSS Score.
