## Why Should I Care?

!!! tip "Prioriitzing by exploitation reduces cost and risk"
    Prioritizing vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild, or
    are more likely to be exploited, reduces the

    1. cost of vulnerability management
    2. risk by reducing the time adversaries have access to vulnerable systems they are trying to exploit

!!! quote 
    -   "*many vulnerabilities classified as
        “critical” are highly complex and have never been seen exploited in
        the wild - in fact, less than 4% of the total number of CVEs have
        been publicly exploited"* (see [BOD 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities)).

        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency emphasizes
        prioritizing remediation of vulnerabilities that are known exploited
        in the wild.
        
    -   "As a
        top priority, focus your efforts on patching the vulnerabilities
        that are being exploited in the wild or have competent compensating
        control(s) that can. This is an effective approach to risk
        mitigation and prevention, yet very few organizations do this. This
        prioritization reduces the number of vulnerabilities to deal with.
        This means you can put more effort into dealing with a smaller
        number of vulnerabilities for the greater benefit of your
        organization's security posture."

## How Many Vulnerabilities are Being Exploited?

!!! info "Only about 5% or fewer of all CVEs have been exploited"
    -   “Less than 3% of vulnerabilities have weaponized exploits or
        evidence of exploitation in the wild, two attributes posing the
        highest risk,” <a

    -   “We observe exploits in the wild for 5.5% of vulnerabilities in our
        dataset,” <a

    In contrast, for CVSS (Base Scores):

    -   ~15% of CVEs are ranked Critical (9+)
    -   ~65% of CVEs are ranked Critical or High (7+)
    -   ~96% of CVEs are ranked Critical or High or Medium (4+)

## What Vulnerabilities are Being Exploited?

!!! tip "There isn't an authoritative common public list of ALL CVEs that are Known Actively Exploited in the wild"

    There is considerable variation in the 

    1. Total Number of Vulnerabilities being Exploited from different sources (per above)
    2. The criteria for "Known Actively Exploited in the wild".

    **CISA KEV includes a subset of Vulnerabilities that are Known-Exploited in the wild.**

!!! info "CISA KEV currently includes ~1.1K CVEs, and defines criteria for inclusion"

    CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (CISA KEV) is a source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild

    There's several criteria including:

    !!! quote
        "A vulnerability under active exploitation is one for which there is reliable evidence that execution of malicious code was performed by an actor on a system without permission of the system owner." 

        "Events that do not constitute as active exploitation, in relation to the KEV catalog, include:
            * Scanning
            * Security research of an exploit
            * Proof of Concept (PoC)
        
        https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities 

!!! info "EPSS provides a probability of exploitation for all published CVEs (in the next 30 days)"

    For EPSS, the criteria for exploit evidence (used to feed the model) is a detection of traffic matching an intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), or honeypot, signature (not a successful exploitation).

    Scanning would likely trigger a detection. In contrast, For CISA KEV, scanning does not constitute as active exploitation.

!!! tip "Various CTI lists other Known-Exploited CVEs"
    There are numerous Cyber Threat Intelligence sources e.g. vendors, publicly available data, that provide lists of CVEs that are Known-Exploited in addition to those listed on CISA KEV.
