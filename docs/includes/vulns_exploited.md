## Why Should I Care?

!!! tip
    Prioritizing vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild, or
    are more likely to be exploited, reduces the

    1. cost of vulnerability management
    2. risk by focusing on the vulnerabilities that need to be fixed first

!!! quote
    -   "*many vulnerabilities classified as
        “critical” are highly complex and have never been seen exploited in
        the wild - in fact, less than 4% of the total number of CVEs have
        been publicly exploited"* (see [BOD 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities)).

        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency emphasizes
        prioritizing remediation of vulnerabilities that are known exploited
        in the wild.
        
    -   "As a
        top priority, focus your efforts on patching the vulnerabilities
        that are being exploited in the wild or have competent compensating
        control(s) that can. This is an effective approach to risk
        mitigation and prevention, yet very few organizations do this. This
        prioritization reduces the number of vulnerabilities to deal with.
        This means you can put more effort into dealing with a smaller
        number of vulnerabilities for the greater benefit of your
        organization's security posture."

## How Many Vulnerabilities are Being Exploited?

!!! info "Only about 5% or fewer of all CVEs have been exploited"
    -   “Less than 3% of vulnerabilities have weaponized exploits or
        evidence of exploitation in the wild, two attributes posing the
        highest risk,” <a

    -   “We observe exploits in the wild for 5.5% of vulnerabilities in our
        dataset,” <a

    In contrast, for CVSS:

    -   ~15% of CVEs are ranked Critical (9+)
    -   ~65% of CVEs are ranked Critical or High (7+)
    -   ~96% of CVEs are ranked Critical or High or Medium (4+)

## What Vulnerabilities are Being Exploited?

!!! info "There isn't an authoritative common public list of ALL CVEs that are Known Actively Exploited in the wild"

    1. CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (CISA KEV) is a source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild
          1. CISA KEV contains ~~10% of known exploited CVEs currently but is growing
          2. There's ~~1K CVEs in CISA KEV, while there are ~~220K published CVEs, and ~~5% of CVEs are known exploited
    2. There are numerous Cyber Threat Intelligence sources e.g. vendors, publicly available data 
    3. EPSS provides a probability of exploitation for all CVEs (in the next 30 days)
