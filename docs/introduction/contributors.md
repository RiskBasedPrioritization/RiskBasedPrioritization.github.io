## Chris Madden
I embarked on this Risk Based Prioritization journey because, as a Product Security engineer, my role is to enable the flow of software/value to our customers by helping deliver high quality software efficiently and securely.

A large part of that was to be able to prioritize vulnerabilities by Real Risk. 

Lots of dumb questions and data analysis later, this guide represents the distillation of that knowledge into a user-centric system view - what I wish I knew before I started - and learnt by interacting with other users, standards groups, and tool vendors. 

There's a friendly vibrant community in this space - many of whom have contributed to this guide.

Special thanks to my colleague Lisa for the expert input, keeping all this real, and tolerating more dumb questions than any human should endure in one lifetime!
