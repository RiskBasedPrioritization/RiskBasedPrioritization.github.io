A witty quote attributed to several notable figures including Niels Bohr, Yogi Berra and a Dutch Politician states, "It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future." While an entertaining turn of phrase, this is exactly what every security practitioner is being asked to do everyday. Every security control, every framework we follow, every patch we prioritize is a prediction about the future. It is a statement saying out of all the possible ways we could improve security, we are predicting these actions will yield the best possible future. 

The word "prediction" may generate a negative connotation for some as it conjures up visions of charlatans with crystal balls. But whether you prefer forecasting, prognostication or following your gut, it doesn't really matter. The fact remains that we must make decisions everyday about the future and typically make those decisions with incomplete information. 

Everyone knows that you probably should not take a card on 17 in blackjack, and betting on a single number in roulette is a long shot. But why? Short answer is that the odds are against a positive outcome with those decisions. Yes, it is possible to get 21 by hitting on 17, and single numbers are paid out in roulette. In the long run though, the more a player can play the odds, the better they do over time. Prediction is difficult, being correct every single time about future events is just not feasible, but by digging into the data, pulling out the important signals can make your decisions better today than they were tomorrow. That's what this framework is attempting to give practitioners â€“ an approach to reduce your uncertainty around vulnerability prioritization and push you closer towards playing the odds.

Chris Madden continues to make significant contributions to the security community, having previously shared Yahoo's innovative approach to [optimizing DevOps pipelines at Bsides Dublin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZN810xfck). In this guide, Chris presents a practical and data-driven approach to risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities.

Within these pages, readers will discover valuable insights from a practitioner's perspective, empowering them to make informed risk decisions, prioritize CVEs effectively, and implement these principles within their own environments.

Chris skillfully combines human-based logic, represented by decision trees aligned with Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), with established open standards such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (CISA KEV), and the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). By doing so, he equips readers with a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage these standards effectively.

With a meticulous emphasis on data-driven analysis and recommendations, Chris provides depth and clarity that are essential for any modern vulnerability management program. This guide is an indispensable resource for security professionals seeking to enhance their approach to risk prioritization.

Security practitioners are currently inundated by vulnerabilities and the state of prioritization does not have any guideline on how to fix vulnerabilities and where to focus. 

This guide is a brilliant starting point for any practitioner that wants to apply prioritization techniques and start making data driven and risk driven decisions. 

As a practitioner myself, I wish I had such a guiding group and guidance when leading vulnerability management efforts. 

Special Kudos to the EPSS group and Chris Madden driving the initiative with an unbiased view and a clean, clear data driven approach.
