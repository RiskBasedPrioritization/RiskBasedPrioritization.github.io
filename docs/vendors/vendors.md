!!! abstract "Overview"

    Different tool vendors use different vulnerability scoring/ranking methods; some use EPSS.

    A full list of vendors using EPSS is given in [List of Vendors using EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/who_is_using).
    This section of the guide

    - lists a selection of vendors using EPSS
    - details how some vendors are using EPSS
  
    A lot of vendors support EPSS in their products, but don't say/know how to apply it, and so there's a need for a guide like this.

| **Qualys**    | Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS) is a Qualys-assigned score for a vulnerability based on multiple factors associated with the CVE such as CVSS and external threat indicators like active exploitation, exploit code maturity, and many more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |              ✅             |

| **Tenable**   | Tenable Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) uses the severity and the facility to be exploited, similar to EPSS.

| **MicroSoft** | *The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                             |
| **Rapid7**    | Rapid7 created a proprietary scoring methodology called Active Risk. It "takes into account the latest version of the CVSS available for a vulnerability and enriches it with multiple threat intelligence feeds, including proprietary Rapid7 research, to provide security teams with a threat-aware vulnerability risk score." Data sources include: CISA KEV, Metasploit, Rapid7's Project Heisenberg and AttackerKB. https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/features/active-risk-score/  https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/09/25/introducing-active-risk/ |                            |

| **Edgescan**  | EPSS is visible as a floating point score (0.00) alongside CVSS, CISAKEV (boolean) and EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score).  Edgescan has also implemented an overall priority score combining CVSS, EPSS and CISA KEV with some weightings to deliver an overall priority score, we call this the Edgescan eXposure Factor (EXF). https://www.edgescan.com/solutions/risk-based-vulnerability-management-rbvm/                                                                                                                     |               ✅              |
