<p>A witty quote attributed to several notable figures including Niels Bohr, Yogi Berra and a Dutch Politician states, "It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future." While an entertaining turn of phrase, this is exactly what every security practitioner is being asked to do everyday. Every security control, every framework we follow, every patch we prioritize is a prediction about the future. It is a statement saying out of all the possible ways we could improve security, we are predicting these actions will yield the best possible future. </p>
<p>The word "prediction" may generate a negative connotation for some as it conjures up visions of charlatans with crystal balls. But whether you prefer forecasting, prognostication or following your gut, it doesn't really matter. The fact remains that we must make decisions everyday about the future and typically make those decisions with incomplete information. </p>
<p>Everyone knows that you probably should not take a card on 17 in blackjack, and betting on a single number in roulette is a long shot. But why? Short answer is that the odds are against a positive outcome with those decisions. Yes, it is possible to get 21 by hitting on 17, and single numbers are paid out in roulette. In the long run though, the more a player can play the odds, the better they do over time. Prediction is difficult, being correct every single time about future events is just not feasible, but by digging into the data, pulling out the important signals can make your decisions better today than they were tomorrow. That's what this framework is attempting to give practitioners – an approach to reduce your uncertainty around vulnerability prioritization and push you closer towards playing the odds.</p>

<p>Chris Madden continues to make significant contributions to the security community, having previously shared Yahoo's innovative approach to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZN810xfck">optimizing DevOps pipelines at Bsides Dublin</a>. In this guide, Chris presents a practical and data-driven approach to risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Within these pages, readers will discover valuable insights from a practitioner's perspective, empowering them to make informed risk decisions, prioritize CVEs effectively, and implement these principles within their own environments.</p>
<p>Chris skillfully combines human-based logic, represented by decision trees aligned with Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (<abbr title="SSVC Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization">SSVC</abbr>), with established open standards such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (<abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr>), <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (<abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>), and the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (<abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr>). By doing so, he equips readers with a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage these standards effectively.</p>
<p>With a meticulous emphasis on data-driven analysis and recommendations, Chris provides depth and clarity that are essential for any modern vulnerability management program. This guide is an indispensable resource for security professionals seeking to enhance their approach to risk prioritization.</p>

<p>Security practitioners are currently inundated by vulnerabilities and the state of prioritization does not have any guideline on how to fix vulnerabilities and where to focus. </p>
<p>This guide is a brilliant starting point for any practitioner that wants to apply prioritization techniques and start making data driven and risk driven decisions. </p>
<p>As a practitioner myself, I wish I had such a guiding group and guidance when leading vulnerability management efforts. </p>
<p>Special Kudos to the <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> group and Chris Madden driving the initiative with an unbiased view and a clean, clear data driven approach. </p></section><section class="print-page" id="introduction-preface"><h1 id="introduction-preface-preface">Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-preface-preface" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I embarked on this journey because, as a Product Security engineer, my role is to enable the flow of value to our customers by helping deliver high quality software efficiently and securely.</p>
<p>A large part of that was to be able to prioritize the ever increasing number of published vulnerabilities (CVEs) by Real <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr>.</p>
<p>Lots of dumb questions and data analysis later, and experience deploying <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization at scale in production, this guide represents the distillation of that knowledge into a user-centric system view - what I wish I knew before I started - and learnt by interacting with other users, standards groups, and tool vendors. </p>
<p><strong>The <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization described in this guide significantly reduces the</strong></p>

<p>This <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization Guide is a pragmatic user-centric view of <a href="#introduction-scope-per-vulnerability">Relative <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> per Vulnerability</a>, the related standards and data sources, and how you can apply them for an effective <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization for your organization.</p>

<p>Each of the <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization Models above use similar risk factors (known exploitation and likelihood of exploitation, with variants of <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard.

The outcome is the same - a much more granular prioritization at the high end of risk than offered by <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard.

<p>Not all <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/state-of-exploit-development/">vulnerabilities or exploits have CVEs</a>.</p>
<p>However, many do, and we can use the data associated with a <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures.

<p>The scope is 
- "Per Vulnerability" branch in the diagram below
- Generic vulnerability data - not the organization-specific context</p>
<p>A different way of looking at this is that this guide (and the prioritization schemes herein), can be used as a first pass triage and prioritization of vulnerabilities, before the overall asset-specific business and runtime context, and remediation context, is considered, and all the context-specific dependencies that go with that.</p>
<p>In other words, Relative <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> per vulnerability.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency emphasizes
prioritizing remediation of vulnerabilities that are known exploited
in the wild:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"As a
    top priority, focus your efforts on patching the vulnerabilities
    that are being exploited in the wild or have competent compensating
    control(s) that can. This is an effective approach to risk
    mitigation and prevention, yet very few organizations do this. This
    prioritization reduces the number of vulnerabilities to deal with.
    This means you can put more effort into dealing with a smaller
    number of vulnerabilities for the greater benefit of your
    organization's security posture." </p>

<p><strong>This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being
attacked, and is based on the current state of exploit techniques,
exploit code availability, or active, “in-the-wild” exploitation.
Public availability of easy-to-use exploit code or exploitation
instructions increases the number of potential attackers by including
those who are unskilled.</strong> Initially, real-world exploitation may only
be theoretical. Publication of proof-of-concept exploit code,
functional exploit code, or sufficient technical details necessary to
exploit the vulnerability may follow. Furthermore, the available
exploit code or instructions may progress from a proof-of-concept
demonstration to exploit code that is successful in exploiting the
vulnerability consistently. In severe cases, it may be delivered as
the payload of a network-based worm or virus or other automated attack
tools.</p>

<p>A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in software or hardware that is unknown to a vendor prior to its public disclosure, or has been publicly disclosed prior to a patch being made available. As soon as a zero day is disclosed and a patch is made available it, of course, joins the pantheon of known vulnerabilities.<br />
Don’t go chasing zero days, patch your known vulnerabilities instead….</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities increase risk, whether or not they start as zero days. We advise organizations to operate with a defensive posture by applying available patches for known, exploited vulnerabilities sooner rather than later.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p><strong>Zero day vulnerabilities made up only approximately 0.4% of vulnerabilities during the past decade.</strong> 
The amount spent on trying to detect them is out of kilter with the actual risks they pose. This is compared with the massive numbers of breaches and infections that come from a small number of known vulnerabilities that are being repeatedly exploited.
As a top priority, focus your efforts on patching the vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild or have competent compensating control(s) that can. This is an effective approach to risk mitigation and prevention, yet very few organizations do this. </p>

<ol>
<li>We use Threat Likelihood of Exploitation per our <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Taxonomy</li>
<li>
<p>For this back of the napkin model, let's assume that</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The odds of a vulnerability being exploited are in the order in
    the diagram (highest risk on top):</p>
<ol>
<li><img alt="Exploitation Known evidence or activity" src="../assets/images/napkin1.png" width="600" /></li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The probabilities quoted in section "Threat Likelihood of

<ol>
<li>37.1% it the vulnerability is weaponized</li>
<li>3.7% if a Proof Of Concept exists</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For counts of CVEs<ol>
<li>the counts of CVEs are per "Likelihood of Exploitation Populations" diagram</li>
<li>there's a relatively small number of vulnerabilities that

<li>We're looking at all published CVEs.<ol>
<li>You could apply this back of the napkin model to the subset

</ol>
</li>
<li>We'll use a very exaggerated figure of ~~20K for CVEs that
    have weaponized exploits or evidence of exploitation in the

<p class="admonition-title">Observations</p>
<p>For this back of the napkin model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Weaponized Exploit Probability of Exploitation (37%) as a
    threshold gives two "10x's"  i.e. at this threshold there's<ol>
<li>10x higher probability of exploitation or greater</li>
<li>there's 10% of CVEs (or &gt;10x more CVEs are below this
    threshold)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>we can see that as we raise the threshold for Probability of
    Exploit, we have less CVEs to fix, (but we may miss some CVEs that
    we should have fixed).</li>
</ol>
<p>For our organization risk posture, maybe we want to use the lower
Probability of Exploitation Threshold associated with a Proof Of Concept
exploit being available (3.7%).</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, there's ~~100K CVEs below this threshold in the back
    of napkin model, and ~~120K above it (to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> based on our
    threshold). So we <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> a lot more CVEs (and a lot more than the

<p>For the benefit of the cybersecurity community and network defenders—and to help every organization better manage vulnerabilities and keep pace with threat activity — <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (<abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>) catalog <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog</a>. </p>
<p>The <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> catalog sends a clear message to all organizations to prioritize remediation efforts on the subset of vulnerabilities that are causing immediate harm based on adversary activity. </p>
<p><strong>Organizations should use the <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> catalog as an input to their vulnerability management prioritization framework.</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerability management frameworks—such as the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (<abbr title="SSVC Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization">SSVC</abbr>) model—consider a vulnerability's exploitation status.</p>

<p>The

not the exploitation observations which are for training and validation

<ul>
<li>So if a vulnerability is rated low, that's because it shares
    attributes (or lack of attributes) with many of the non-exploited

<p><abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> probabilities are the direct result of the automated data we
receive and collect <em>about</em> a vulnerability. <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> is based on (to the
best of our knowledge) a list of human curated CVEs with historical
exploitation activity. And so given the different data generating
processes, it is entirely reasonable that a given <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr> would appear on
<abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>, while also receiving a low <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score. Or alternatively, that a <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr>
would have a high <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score, but not appear on <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>.<br />
<br />
The <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> probability is the result of a predictive model trained on
previous daily exploitation activity. A higher score indicates the
vulnerability is presenting itself (in data) similar to previously and
routinely exploited vulnerabilities and conversely a lower score
indicates the vulnerability is presenting itself like the
vulnerabilities where we, or our data partners, observed less or no
exploitation activity. We can see this in the plots below:</p>
<figure>

<p><img alt="epss_days_observed" src="../assets/images/epss_days_observed.png" /></p>

<p>In order to understand what we said above, "A higher score indicates the
vulnerability is presenting itself (in data) similar to previously and
routinely exploited vulnerabilities and conversely a lower score
indicates the vulnerability is presenting itself like the
vulnerabilities where we, or our data partners, observed less or no
exploitation activity." I filtered CVEs down to those just on the <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>
and split them into 5 categories based on <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score (shown here with
the counts in each category):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>  epss_range          count

4 (0.896,0.972]       204
5 (0.972,0.976]       205

<p>We can then look at the proportion of CVEs in each category with
specific attributes <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> derived from data about those vulnerabilities:</p>

prioritize.  How would <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard.

at the top of each scoring system and <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> everything going down
the scoring range, how many do you have to prioritize before you close
all or even "most" of the CVEs? </p>

CVEs) that is prioritized as you move down the scoring system.</p>
<p>Bottom to top represents the amount of "coverage" for the <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> list.</p>
<p>As we put in more effort (prioritize more CVEs) we will cover more and
more of the <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> CVEs, so as the lines move from left to right, we (the

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Weaponized Exploits and <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr></p>
<p>One could make the argument for not using "Weaponized Exploits" as part of our policy: <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> has all those other variables in the model, basically it's extracted all the information out of those, so trying to do something with those next to <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>But this could also be said of <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>. </p>
<p>Throughout this guide, it's been shown that in some cases <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> scores will be persistently low even when there is evidence of exploitation, (and <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> should be used in conjunction with evidence of exploitation) e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#vendors-microsoft_exploitability_index">Microsoft Exploitability Index</a></li>
<li><a href="#vendors-qualys">Qualys</a></li>
<li><a href="#cisa_kev-cisa_kev"><abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr></a></li>
<li><a href="#epss-applying_epss_to_your_environment">Applying <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> to your environment</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, we're taking the same approach; overall <a href="#introduction-code_and_data">the population for weaponized is small</a> - and an org will have a subset of these - so the extra effort is generally low.
Also, mature risk based prioritization schemes may be using weaponized exploits as an input already - and want to add <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> as pre-threat intel e.g.</p>
<ul>

<p>Looking at real <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures.

<p>In other words, the general guidance to "Start by picking an <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> Threshold around 10%" stands, but picking the <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> value from the plot for your data will give you better coverage/efficiency/effort.</p>

<p><strong>Monte Carlo Analysis</strong></p>
<p>CVEs in an Organization vs All CVEs</p>
<ul>
<li>We're more interested in a sample of CVEs (not all CVEs) e.g. the
    sample in our organization which will likely be a much smaller
    subset of all CVEs.</li>
<li>Each organization will have a different subset of CVEs, and this
    data is private, so we can't do an analysis of that.</li>
<li>A typical enterprise will have ~10K's of CVEs i.e. <strong>we know the
    counts of CVEs - but not the CVEs themselves.</strong><ul>
<li>So we can plot a random sample of that count of CVEs, and repeat
    many times to see what the overall plot looks like and if it is
    useful.</li>
<li>And we can do this for different counts of CVEs e.g. 1K, 11K
    (5%) CVEs, or 44K (20%) CVEs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to understand the count of CVEs with <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score above some
threshold</p>
<ol>
<li>So we pick a sample of ~40K CVEs</li>
<li>But we don't know which ~40K subset of CVEs are relevant for a
    typical Enterprise</li>
<li>Instead of picking an exact ~40K subset of CVEs, we can pick lots
    of ~40K subsets of CVEs randomly, and plot them all.<ol>
<li><strong>We would know that any Enterprise with the number of CVEs would be
    represented in those plots</strong></li>

exploited by a Threat per <a

rel="nofollow">NIST Special Publication 800-30 r1 Guide for Conducting
<abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Assessments</a>.</p>
<p>One approach to assess risk is to do multiple passes - starting with a
first pass triage of vulnerabilities</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First pass: Prioritize Vulnerabilities in an automated way
    independent of Asset</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Given a list of vulnerabilities, prioritize them given what we
    know about the vulnerability from multiple data sources
    (independent of the assets i.e. assume a generic asset for risk
    purposes for this first pass).</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Second pass: Dependent on Asset<ol>
<li>There can be MANY independent parameters that determine the risk
    associated with an Asset e.g.<ol>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Exposure e.g. open (to the internet)</li>
<li>Reachability - is the vulnerable method called</li>
<li>Compensating controls</li>
<li>Underlying Stack component versions in place e.g.
    SpringShell Spring Framework exploitability depends on
    certain JDK versions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Many of these parameters are generic for the vulnerabilities
    associated with the Asset - and are known in advance and fixed
    e.g. Asset Value, Asset Exposure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Some of the parameters will depend on the specific vulnerability and
    the pre-conditions it needs to implement the full kill-chain. E.g.
    exploitable depending on the configuration or runtime context of the
    vulnerable software.</li>
</ol>
<p>This 2 pass approach allows us to first determine the highest priority
vulnerabilities - and then assess these against our highest
value/exposure assets.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll walk through this First Pass triage - using a Decision Tree to
prioritize the vulnerabilities.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’ll build this Decision Tree from scratch.</strong></li>
<li><strong>An extract of the data is shown for each step. So we can see
    what’s happening without needing to understand the code</strong></li>
<li>A key benefit to Decision Trees is that they are understandable. The
    implementation of them should support that too. So the code here
    aims for clarity e.g. laid out inline.</li>

<p>Qualys TruRisk is hyper focused on three attributes: <strong>exploit availability, evidence of exploitation in the wild, and likelihood of exploitation</strong>. This helps organizations focus on the highest risk vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>QVS scores consistently <strong>place vulnerabilities with evidence of exploitation, such as <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> known vulnerabilities, in a higher score range even if the <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score is low</strong></p>
<p><strong>Qualys TruRisk rates less than 1% of vulnerabilities as critical, and less than 7% of vulnerabilities as high. This drastically reduces the number of vulnerabilities (up to 85% fewer compared to <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> which ranks 51% of vulnerabilities high or critical) that organizations need to focus on to reduce risk</strong></p>
<p>The QDS algorithm <strong>rates weaponized exploits higher than PoC exploits.</strong></p>

<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p><strong>Organizations considering the implementation of risk-based vulnerability management should incorporate <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> as one of the criteria for prioritization. However, similar to <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>, it would be imprudent to rely solely on <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> for prioritization as it may overlook high-risk vulnerabilities or those being exploited in the wild.</strong></p>
<p>Qualys VMDR, in tandem with TruRisk, utilizes <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> scores as part of the scoring algorithm to consistently rank CVEs with a high likelihood of exploitation within the critical range.</p>
<p>Even if a vulnerability has a weaponized exploit available, it is assigned a High level of criticality. The underlying assumption being attackers could use it at any point in time. As more evidence of exploitation becomes available, the score is further increased.</p>
<p><strong>The prioritization of vulnerabilities should be a multifaceted approach. The focus should be given to those known to be exploited in the wild (<abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr>), those with a high likelihood of exploitation (indicated by a high <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> score), and those with weaponized exploit code available</strong></p>

<p>Rather than playing whack-a-mole with vulnerabilities, the following 3
independent steps are applied to focus on what needs to be fixed first
(where each step on its own gives a very significant reduction in CVEs
to fix):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Root Cause</strong><ol>
<li>Do some initial easy Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the
    root causes of CVEs in the DevOps pipeline i.e. find the source
    of the moles and address them. <ol>
<li>One Programming Language in particular accounted for a very
    significant proportion of CVEs<ol>
<li>This was due to the Open Source dependencies for this
    programming language not being up to date</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>By updating dependencies (automatically), the number of CVEs
    reduced very significantly over time!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Addressing the root cause avoids playing whack-a-mole by
    eliminating the source of the moles</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Reachability</strong><ol>
<li>Some (SCA (Software Composition Analysis) and image scan) tools
    support reachability analysis that indicate if a vulnerability
    in the vulnerable dependency is actually called by the App code
    or not<ol>
<li>in general, a significant number of CVEs reported by
    SCA, image scanners are not reachable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are also tools that check Network reachability of vulnerabilities, 
    and some validate exploitability.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization</strong><ol>
<li>As seen throughout this guide, focusing on CVEs that are, or are
    likely to be, exploited, gives a very significant reduction in
    CVEs to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> and associated effort!</li>

<p>Here the requirements for a <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization Scheme are listed as provided by users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any solution should be informed by what the user wants, and the rationale behind the solution implementation. This allows understanding and validation of the solution against the requirements and rationale. </li>
<li>The broader set of users' requirements is expressed as <a href="#requirements-requirements">User Scenarios and User Stories</a>.</li>

<li>The output (score/rating) should be wedge shaped with the sharp end representing the high risk end i.e. there should be a relatively small number of CVEs at the top end of risk.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Understandable</strong><ol>
<li>The rationale, and preferably the requirements or problem statement, should be stated so it's clear what problem the solution is trying to solve, and the rationale for how it solves it.</li>
<li>Given the output (score/rating), it should be possible to easily and uniquely identify the input parameters(s), and the contribution of the input parameters(s) values to the output.</li>
<li>A non-technical person should be able to understand it</li>

<li><strong>Extensible</strong><ol>
<li>Organizations may want to extend, customize, or optimize a <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Based Prioritization Scheme for their environment e.g. change the prioritization associated with a data source or add a new data source.</li>
<li>Some schemes do this by design e.g. <em>"<a href="https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC"><abbr title="SSVC Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization">SSVC</abbr></a> aims to avoid one-size-fits-all solutions in favor of a modular decision-making system with clearly defined and tested parts that vulnerability managers can select and use as appropriate to their context."</em></li>

<li>As users using several solutions, we'd like the risk based prioritization scheme to be standard and interoperable and an industry standard so we have consistent ratings across solutions.</li>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: There are several tools and services running in the
DevOps pipeline that detect vulnerabilities in OSS (Open Source
Software)</p>
<ul>
<li>Most, but not all, of these have CVEs</li>
<li>The CVEs are in the application OSS code, and the underlying stack
    (Container and Operating Systems OSS code)</li>
<li>A relatively small number of vulnerabilities account for the
    majority of the count of vulnerabilities e.g. there may be 1000's of
    a few CVEs but 10 or less of most CVEs.</li>
<li>All the tools support <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr>, some support <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> more recently (though
    the tool vendor did not provide guidance on how to use <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Optimize the flow of software through the DevOps pipeline
versus security risk. </p>
<p>→  Gather vulnerabilities reported by several tools across the DevOps
pipeline</p>
<p>→  Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on risk</p>
<p>→ Data sources for risk are defined</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Narrative</strong> <sub><em>(how things are now)</em></sub></p>
<p>As a Product Engineer, I’m drowning in a sea of CVEs! They just keep
coming, more and more every year - it’s relentless!</p>
<p>We use <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> because our:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools report <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most CVEs have a high <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> score, so we have to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> most things.
It’s whack-a-mole!</p>
<p>I don’t have a good understanding of all the tools in our DevOps
pipeline and the vulnerability data they produce. And I don’t know how
to get it. DevOps Tools don’t help us here.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Narrative</strong>
<sub><em>(how we want things to be in the future - aspirational)</em></sub></p>
<p>As a Product Engineer, I care most about my effort vs risk i.e. the
effort to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> the vulnerabilities in my environment.</p>
<p>I use <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> as a key part of my risk-based prioritization (along with
Reachability analysis, and Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the
root systemic causes for my CVEs).</p>
<p><strong>Overall, applying these 3 independent measures, I get a 10x reduction in effort and CVEs to fix! Now we’re sailing!</strong></p>

<div class="admonition userstory">
<p class="admonition-title">Security Manager - Get teams to focus on the real issues</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: CVEs provide a standardized way to identify and track
security vulnerabilities across software, services, hardware, SaaS,
APIs, etc. CISOs use CVEs to assess the level of risk associated with
specific vulnerabilities. The number of CVEs typically indicate the
overall security landscape and help prioritize which vulnerabilities
should be addressed first.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Narrative</strong> <sub><em>(how things are now)</em></sub></p>
<p>CISOs are constantly subject to allocate their limited resources effectively. Knowing the number of CVEs on hand helps them determine where to focus their efforts. High-severity vulnerabilities with a large number of reported CVEs may take precedence over others, as they pose a greater risk.</p>
<p>The greater the organization, the more complex the situation gets.</p>
<p>If this is not enough, CISOs and directs constantly have a battle with Business, Engineering, Applications teams to provide evidence why a <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr> needs to be fixed. Existing scoring like CVSS3 having limitations. Although bigger organizations have access to Threat Intel where <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> can be married to the threat intel feeds, but this is usually a pipe dream for SMBs or organizations with reduced security budgets.</sub></p>
<p><strong>Post-Narrative</strong>
<sub><em>(how we want things to be in the future - aspirational)</em></sub></p>
<p>Taking <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> along with Business Context into account will really help organizations to sift through the CVEs. Focus from VM and Applications teams can be tailored towards fixing the most critical of issues. This will also help with the conversation with Business and App Teams, and reduce (if not eliminate) friction between Security and non-security Teams.</sub></p>

<p><strong>Narrative</strong>: Update the policy documentation to Remediate CVEs above a certain <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> threshold</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Narrative</strong> <sub><em>(how things are now)</em></sub></p>
<p>Right now, there is a handful of organizations really taking <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> into
consideration as a prioritization tool. <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> threshold is a thought and
there is no industry wide consensus of what an optimal <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> threshold
is. Additionally, such guidance is also included from the regulatory
bodies as an acceptable metric. </p>
<p><strong>Post-Narrative</strong>
<sub><em>(how we want things to be in the future - aspirational)</em></sub></p>
<p>Taking <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> along with Business Context into account will really help organizations to sift through the CVEs. A clear policy not only needs to be defined and accepted by different functions in the organizations, the process of prioritization needs to be automated to consider business context, criticality of the application.

<p class="admonition-title"><abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> Management - Provide users of the solution a roadmap and priority list of vulnerabilities to address as the landscape evolves</p>
<p>How <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> is deployed and can be used by a tool vendor to assist with
vulnerability prioritization at scale. <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> can provide additional
embellishment/metadata of a discovered vulnerability and focus and
organization efforts on what to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> first. </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Current state of play: </p>
<p>Most cyber security teams are drowning in <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr>'s and high scoring <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr>
(Common Vulnerability Scoring System). This is the result of treating
vulnerabilities with little or no context. The intelligent approach is
to address vulnerabilities based on risk of breach. Which vulnerabilities
should I address to lower the probability of breach?   </p>
<p>A vulnerability management programme should be designed in such a way
that weaknesses and risks to an organization are addressed first. The
reality of vulnerability management and mitigation is that "we can’t fix
all the vulnerabilities". This is due to resource, cost and value
considerations. It makes no financial sense focusing on fixing all
vulnerabilities faced by an organization, there are generally too many.
When mitigating vulnerabilities and protecting an organization attention
needs to be paid to vulnerabilities which have a significant statistical
chance of being exploited and damaging an enterprise. The return on
investment of addressing vulnerabilities which have a low probability of
being used in a breach attempt is extremely low and wasteful of limited
resources. Unfortunately some compliance frameworks require
vulnerabilities to be mitigated regardless of the probability of breach,
<abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> does not solve this blunt approach to cyber resilience. </p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>Provide users of the solution a roadmap and priority list of
vulnerabilities to address as the landscape evolves.<br />
The landscape is a twofold beast;</p>
<ol>
<li>Technology changes over time, change introduces risk which may
    introduce weakness and vulnerability. Today’s secure system may be
    insecure tomorrow due to an unknown vulnerability being discovered.
    This is not uncommon and a continuous challenge..</li>
<li>The threat actor landscape can evolve, approach to breach &amp;
    cybercriminality and tooling used by threat actors can change the
    priority of a vulnerability. Today threat actors and industrialized
    cybercrime are focusing and commonly using <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr>-2023-XYZ, tomorrow
    this may change and additional vulnerabilities may be used in
    addition. </li>
</ol>
<p>Most medium sized organizations and enterprises have tens, if not
hundreds, of open vulnerabilities. Most organizations have a stretched
cyber security team and product development teams should be focusing on
new product not retrofitting. These challenges combined, result in not
having the ability to <abbr title="The neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.">remediate</abbr> all the vulnerabilities all the time. We must
be able to prioritize based on real-world data. Vulnerability severity
score alone does not necessarily mean such a vulnerability is commonly
used to breach a system.  <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> can be used to provide real-world breach
prediction metadata per vulnerability in order to guide an organization
on which issues need to be addressed first relative to the long backlog
of vulnerabilities most organization are faced with.   </p>
<p>It's not uncommon to combine <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> with other vulnerability severity
rating metadata, In the case of Edgescan this is <abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> <abbr title="Known Exploited Vulnerability">KEV</abbr> (<abbr title="Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency">CISA</abbr> Known
Exploitable Vulnerability Catalog), <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> (Common Vulnerability Scoring
System) and  in the case of Edgescan, EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security
Score). Combining such metadata can provide much higher fidelity in
terms of prioritization. </p>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerability management programmes generally have a number of metrics
to measure by. Most common are <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr>, A tool risk score (generally
without context), Vulnerability age (date opened/date closed), to name a
few....</p>
<p>Context: Generally speaking using <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> alone is a blunt instrument as it
does not have any context in relation to the business value of the
vulnerable asset, chance of breach is ignored etc. <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> is still used
for compliance (such as PCI DSS) and simple ordering of vulnerabilities
relative to each other. <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> does not have business context but has
breach probability. When breach probability is combined with internal
metadata such as asset importance this can hugely assist with
prioritization.</p>
<p>Independence: A value-add of <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> is the fact that the data is derived
by an independent third party with greater reach than most private or
proprietary risk models.  It reflects the real world without any
commercial bias; this is important.</p>

<p>Many vulnerabilities don't have CVEs but represent a real risk - these

<p>Per The State of Exploit Development: 80% of Exploits Publish Faster
than CVEs</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Of the 45,450 public exploits in Exploit Database, there are 11,079
    (~26%) exploits in Exploit Database that have mapped <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr> numbers.</em></li>
<li><em>Among those 11,079 exploits:</em><ul>
<li><em>14% are zero-day (published before the vendors release the
    patch), 23% are published within a week after the patch release
    and 50% are published within a month after the patch release. On
    average, an exploit is published 37 days after the patch is
    released. Patch as soon as possible – the risk of a
    vulnerability being exploited increases quickly after vendors
    release the patches.</em></li>
<li><em>80% of public exploits are published before the CVEs are
    published. On average, an exploit is published 23 days before
    the <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr> is published. Software and hardware may also have
    vulnerabilities with public exploits that don't have CVEs. Check

</ul>
<p>Per Focus on the Biggest Security Threats, Not the Most Publicized,
Gartner, Nov 2017</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Zero day vulnerabilities made up only approximately 0.4% of
    vulnerabilities during the past decade.</em></li>
<li><em>The amount spent on trying to detect them is out of kilter with the
    actual risks they pose. This is compared with the massive numbers of
    breaches and infections that come from a small number of known

<li><em>As a top priority, focus your efforts on patching the

<p><strong>Narrative</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>Pre-Narrative</strong> <sub><em>(how things are now)</em></sub></p>
<p>When a zero-day drops, it takes days before "the dust settles and there
is clarity" on the risk associated with the vulnerability.</p>
<p>It's typically a manual exercise repeated simultaneously by many

<p>I don't have a good overall risk rating or prioritization (including
exploitation probability) for my vulnerabilities</p>
<p>→ For vulnerabilities without CVEs, I don't have a good "risk rating"
(including exploitation probability).</p>
<p>→ If only <em>~26% of vulnerabilities have CVEs, I don't have a good "risk

<p><strong>Post-Narrative</strong>
<sub><em>(how we want things to be in the future - aspirational)</em></sub></p>
<p>As <u>Any</u>, I can assess the risk associated with <u>any
vulnerability</u> based on the meta-data / parameters for that
vulnerability.</p>
<p>This "risk rating" (including exploitation probability) is available via
a unique globally recognized identifier for that vulnerability e.g.
OSVD, GHSA, <abbr title="CVE Common Vulnerability and Exposures. A standardized list of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation.">CVE</abbr>....</p>
<p>I recognize that this "risk rating" is very volatile initially in the
case of zero-days - but it is fresh (reflects current known
information - which changes significantly in the first few days of a
zero-day)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: </p>
<p>"<abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> is per Asset and depends on Impact of a Vulnerability being
exploited by a Threat" per Elements of <abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr>. That asset can be tangible
(e.g. a server, a facility, etc.) or intangible (e.g. an application, a
virtual machine, a container, data, etc.). The level(s) that you track
risk for tangible and intangible assets will depend on your goals and
objectives. It probably does not make sense to track risk for assets
that you don't intend to manage. For example, it is probably sufficient
to track risk at the application level as compared to the component
level, such as the web server, the app server, the database server,
etc.) unless different people are responsible for managing each of these
components. A key point in being able to track risk is to be able to
measure by area of responsibility whether overall risk is getting better
or worse and then to be able to drill down into the risk and ascertain
where the increases and decreases are coming from. </p>
<p><abbr title="The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential impact of such an exploit on an organization.">Risk</abbr> can be approached from different perspectives:</p>

<p>Also, given <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> is a probability, it is technically possible to combine

in mind that <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> considers the likelihood of attempted exploitation.
Even if the exploitation is attempted, it may not actually be
successful, such as due to reachability issues and compensating

<p>E.g. taking a recent Research Analysis "Commonalities in Vehicle

<p>Automotive manufacturers and vendors should not hyper-focus on
critical-risk and high-risk vulnerabilities, and thus overlook
vulnerabilities categorized as medium-risk and below. Attackers are
inherently languid, and most exploits discovered in the wild follow
the path of least resistance. <strong>Tolerating medium-risk vulnerabilities
could lead to a rise in attack chains that achieve a critical

are telling me it already has a public exploit?” Ideally, <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> scores
would factor in already published exploits and skip this step.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Remediation SLA</p>
<p>As Any, I want to have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) based on risk, so
there is a clear definition of when a vulnerability should be fixed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In govt space they still rely on remediation SLAs based on <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr>
severity. As do many commercial orgs not yet educated to the nuances
of determining a vuln severity. I think using fairly common
terms/bins/labels would help folks grasp an understanding of <abbr title="Exploit Prediction Scoring System">EPSS</abbr> more
quickly. Labels/bins are already arbitrary in <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System Standard. A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability and impact.">CVSS</abbr> but it’s still
heavily relied upon.</p>
