Which vulnerabilities should I address to lower the probability of breach?\u00a0 \u00a0</p> <p>A vulnerability management programme should be designed in such a way that weaknesses and risks to an organisation are addressed first. The reality of vulnerability management and mitigation is that \"we can\u2019t fix all the vulnerabilities\". This is due to resource, cost and value considerations. It makes no financial sense focusing on fixing all vulnerabilities faced by an organisation, there are generally too many. When mitigating vulnerabilities and protecting an organisation attention needs to be paid to vulnerabilities which have a significant statistical chance of being exploited and damaging an enterprise. The return on investment of addressing vulnerabilities which have a low probability of being used in a breach attempt is extremely low and wasteful of limited resources. Unfortunately some compliance frameworks require vulnerabilities to be mitigated regardless of the probability of breach, EPSS does not solve this blunt approach to cyber resilience.\u00a0</p> <p>Objective</p> <p>Provide users of the solution a roadmap and priority list of vulnerabilities to address as the landscape evolves. The landscape is a twofold beast;</p> <ol> <li>Technology changes over time, change introduces risk which may     introduce weakness and vulnerability.

This is not uncommon and a continuous challenge..</li> <li>The threat actor landscape can evolve, approach to breach &amp;     cybercriminality and tooling used by threat actors can change the     priority of a vulnerability. Today threat actors and industrialized     cybercrime are focusing and commonly using CVE-2023-XYZ, tomorrow     this may change and additional vulnerabilities may be used in     addition.\u00a0</li> </ol> <p>Most medium sized organizations and enterprises have tens, if not hundreds, of open vulnerabilities. Most organizations have a stretched cyber security team and product development teams should be focusing on new product not retrofitting. These challenges combined, result in not having the ability to remediate all the vulnerabilities all the time. We must be able to prioritize based on real-world data. Vulnerability severity score alone does not necessarily mean such a vulnerability is commonly used to breach a system. \u00a0EPSS can be used to provide real-world breach prediction metadata per vulnerability in order to guide an organisation on which issues need to be addressed first relative to the long backlog of vulnerabilities most organisation are faced with. \u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>It's not uncommon to combine EPSS with other vulnerability severity rating metadata, In the case of Edgescan this is CISA KEV (CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability Catalog), CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and\u00a0 in the case of Edgescan, EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score). Combining such metadata can provide much higher fidelity in terms of priortization.\u00a0</p> <p>Narrative</p> <p>Vulnerability management programmes generally have a number of metrics to measure by. Most common are CVSS, A tool risk score (generally without context), Vulnerability age (date opened/date closed), to name a few....</p> <p>Context: Generally speaking using CVSS alone is a blunt instrument as it does not have any context in relation to the business value of the vulnerable asset, chance of breach is ignored etc. CVSS is still used for compliance (such as PCI DSS) and simple ordering of vulnerabilities relative to each other. EPSS does not have business context but has breach probability. When breach probability is combined with internal metadata such as asset importance this can hugely assist with prioritization.</p> <p>Independence: A value-add of EPSS is the fact that the data is derived by an independent third party with greater reach than most private or proprietary risk models. \u00a0It reflects the real world without any commercial bias; this is important.</p>"},{"location":"requirements/Requirements/#knowing-risk-for-a-vulnerability-before-or-without-a-cve","title":"Knowing Risk for a Vulnerability Before or Without a CVE","text":"<p>Any - Knowing Risk for a Vulnerability Before or Without a CVE</p> <p>Background:\u00a0</p> <p>Many vulnerabilities don't have CVEs but represent a real risk - these include, but are not limited to, zero-days.</p> <p>Per The State of Exploit Development: 80% of Exploits Publish Faster than CVEs</p> <ul> <li>Of the 45,450 public exploits in Exploit Database, there are 11,079     (~26%) exploits in Exploit Database that have mapped CVE numbers.</li> <li>Among those 11,079 exploits:<ul> <li>14% are zero-day (published before the vendors release the     patch), 23% are published within a week after the patch release     and 50% are published within a month after the patch release.
